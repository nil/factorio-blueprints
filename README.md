# Factorio blueprints — by Nil Vila

My collection of Blueprints for Factorio. You are free to use them, modify them and open an issue if you find an error or want to suggest an improvement.

## Collection

### 1. Robot rush base [v1.0.0]

A progresive base to quickly research and build robots. Based on Nilau’s Jump Start Base, but adapted to fit blue sience and robots.
